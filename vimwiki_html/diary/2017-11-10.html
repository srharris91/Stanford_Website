<a href="Worked.html">Worked</a> on turbulence hw for the last few days.  Took a lot of work this time.  Homework problem set # 6
</p>

<p>
I also may have gotten sidetracked a setup a personal website at 
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;stanford.edu&#47;~srharris&#47;">http://stanford.edu/~srharris/</a>
it's still a major work in progress though.  I would love to make this my personal website and document all the things I learn and all my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Wonder if I could mix my vimwiki items in there too.  I bet I could.... I'll have to figure that out.
