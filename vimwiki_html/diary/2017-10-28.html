<p>
Today we went and cleaned the church.  We woke up a little late, but it was good.  Cleaned windows, chalkboards, and the kitchen.

Pretty nice to get out and working with our hands.  Laurie signed us up when she went Relief Society this last.  Guess we're paying the price now that Laurie is going to Relief Society and I'm still stuck in the primary sunbeams class.  It's good she is getting to go to class and see all the Relief Society sisters, but it does give her a chance to sign us up for volunteer service opportunities that we normally don't have the chance to do.
